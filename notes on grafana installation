Installing and Configuring Grafana

Add the GPG key for the Grafana OSS repository, and then add the repository:
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"

Install the Grafana package:
  sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties- common wget
  
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install grafana=6.6.2

Enable and start the grafana-server service: sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
sudo systemctl start grafana-server

Make sure the service is in the Active (running) state: sudo systemctl status grafana-server
You can verify Grafana is working by accessing it in a web browser at http:// <IP>:3000.
Log in to Grafana with the username admin and password admin. 
Reset the password when prompted.

Click Add data source.
Select Prometheus.

For the URL, enter http://<PROMETHEUS_IP>:9090. 
Click Save & Test. 
You should see a banner that says Data source is working. 
If you click on the explore button in Grafana you are moved to a page where you can
select a data source and run a query for them (if it is Prometheus it's going to be PromSQl)
Test your setup by running a query to get some Prometheus data. 

In the PromQL Query input, enter a simple query, such as up. Execute the query. You should see some data appear.
   
Grafana has a set of preconfigured dashboards (for Prometheus and other sources)
